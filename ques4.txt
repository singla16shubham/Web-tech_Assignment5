This code will not compile because:
void is a keyword that means that a function does not result a value.
Void is a reference type.
As a result type (a function with a return value of type Void) it means that the function always return null.
 it cannot return anything other than null, because Void has no instances.

 Also in m1 function after the line System.out.print(a) there should be ; in place of :
